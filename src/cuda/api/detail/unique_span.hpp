/**
 * An `std::dynarry`-inspired class: Contiguous storage; size always equal to the capacity, and both
 * set at construction time; and dynamic storage, allocated _separately_ from this class itself.
 *
 * @note in owning standard-library containers, allocation is tied up with the container class itself,
 * via an Allocator template parameter. This class forgoes that "pleasure" - which is more feasible
 * considering how re-allocation is never necessary - and simply takes the allocated memory on
 * construction.
 *
 * @note unique_span is similar to the `dynarray` container, which was proposed for, but not finally
 * included in, C++14. It can be though of as a variation on std::array, with the the size and capacity
 * set dynamically, at construction time, rather than statically.
 *
 * @note unique_span = unique_span+typing or span+ownership+non_null
 *
 * @tparam T the type of individual elements in the unique_span
