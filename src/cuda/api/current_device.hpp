/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief Wrappers for getting and setting CUDA's choice of
 * which device is 'current'
 *
 * CUDA has one device set as 'current'; and much of the Runtime API
 * implicitly refers to that device only. This file contains wrappers
 * for getting and setting it - as standalone functions - and
 * a RAII class which can be used for setting it for the duration of
 * a scope, popping back the old setting as the scope is exited.
 *
 * @note that code for getting the current device as a CUDA device
 * proxy class is found in @ref device.hpp
 *
 * @note the scoped device setter is used extensively throughout
 * this CUDA API wrapper library.
