/**
 * @file kernel_launch.hpp
 *
 * @brief Variadic, chevron-less wrappers for the CUDA kernel launch mechanism.
 *
 * This file has two stand-alone functions used for launching kernels - by
 * application code directly and by other API wrappers (e.g. @ref cuda::device_t
 * and @ref cuda::stream_t ).
 *
 * <p>The wrapper functions have two goals:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Avoiding the annoying triple-chevron syntax, e.g.
 *
 *   my_kernel<<<launch, config, stuff>>>(real, args)
 *
 * and sticking to proper C++; in other words, the wrappers are "ugly"
 * instead of client code having to be.
 * <li>Avoiding some of the "parameter soup" of launching a kernel: It's
 * rather easy to mix up shared memory sizes with stream IDs; grid and
 * block dimensions with each other; and even grid/block dimensions with
 * the scalar parameters - since a `dim3` is constructible from
 * integral values. Instead, we enforce a launch configuration structure:
 * {@ref cuda::launch_configuration_t}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @note You'd probably better avoid launching kernels using these
 * function directly, and go through the @ref cuda::stream_t or @ref cuda::device_t
 * proxy classes' launch mechanism (e.g.
 * `my_stream.enqueue.kernel_launch(...)`).
 *
 * @note Even though when you use this wrapper, your code will not have the silly
 * chevron, you can't use it from regular `.cpp` files compiled with your host
 * compiler. Hence the `.cuh` extension. You _can_, however, safely include this
 * file from your `.cpp` for other definitions. Theoretically, we could have
 * used the `cudaLaunchKernel` API function, by creating an array on the stack
 * which points to all of the other arguments, but that's kind of redundant.

/**
 * @brief Enqueues a kernel on a stream (=queue) on the current CUDA device.
 *
 * CUDA's 'chevron' kernel launch syntax cannot be compiled in proper C++. Thus, every kernel launch must
 * at some point reach code compiled with CUDA's nvcc. Naively, every single different kernel (perhaps up
 * to template specialization) would require writing its own wrapper C++ function, launching it. This
 * function, however, constitutes a single minimal wrapper around the CUDA kernel launch, which may be
 * called from proper C++ code (across translation unit boundaries - the caller is compiled with a C++
 * compiler, the callee compiled by nvcc).
 *
 * <p>This function is similar to C++17's `std::apply`, or to a a beta-reduction in Lambda calculus:
 * It applies a function to its arguments; the difference is in the nature of the function (a CUDA kernel)
 * and in that the function application requires setting additional CUDA-related launch parameters,
 * additional to the function's own.
 *
 * <p>As kernels do not return values, neither does this function. It also contains no hooks, logging
 * commands etc. - if you want those, write an additional wrapper (perhaps calling this one in turn).
 *
 * @param thread_block_cooperation if true, use CUDA's "cooperative launch" mechanism which enables more flexible
 * synchronization capabilities (see CUDA C Programming Guide C.3. Grid Synchronization). Note that this is a
 * requirement of the kernel function rather than merely an arbitrary choice.
 * @param kernel_function the kernel to apply. Pass it just as-it-is, as though it were any other function. Note:
 * If the kernel is templated, you must pass it fully-instantiated. Alternatively, you can pass a
 * @ref kernel_t wrapping the raw pointer to the function.
 * @param stream the CUDA hardware command queue on which to place the command to launch the kernel (affects
 * the scheduling of the launch and the execution)
 * @param launch_configuration a kernel is launched on a grid of blocks of thread, and with an allowance of
 * shared memory per block in the grid; this defines how the grid will look and what the shared memory
 * allowance will be (see {@ref cuda::launch_configuration_t})
 * @param parameters whatever parameters @p kernel_function takes
 *
 * @note If the Kernel type is kernel_t, it will already have a thread_block_cooperation setting, so using this
 * variant of `enqueue_launch` is somewhat redundant; at any rate, the value passed for @p thread_block_cooperation
 * must match the kernel function's needs, with the kernel_t wrapper is assumed to indicate. Behavior on mismatch
 * is undefined.
